Given the extraordinary growth we saw in 2020 when customers predominantly stayed home, and the fact that we’ve continued to grow on top of that in 2021, our Retail teammates have effectively operated in peak mode for almost two years. It’s been a tremendous effort, and I’m appreciative and proud of how hard our teams have worked to serve customers. As expected over the holidays, we saw higher costs driven by labor supply shortages and inflationary pressures, and these issues persisted into the first quarter due to Omicron. Despite these short-term challenges, we continue to feel optimistic and excited about the business as we emerge from the pandemic. When you combine how we’re staffing and scaling our fulfillment network to bring even faster delivery to more customers, the extraordinary growth of AWS with 40% year-over-year growth (and now a $71 billion revenue run rate), the addition of marquee new entertainment like The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power and Thursday Night Football, and a plethora of new capabilities that we’re building in areas like Alexa, Ring, Grocery, Pharmacy, Amazon Care, Kuiper, and Zoox, there’s a lot to look forward to in the months and years ahead. Amazon also continues to invest heavily in Prime. In the last few years, Amazon has added more product selection available with fast, free, unlimited Prime shipping; more exclusive deals and discounts; and more high-quality digital entertainment, including TV, movies, music, and books. Since 2018, Prime Video has tripled the number of Amazon Originals, rolling out new series and movies like The Boys, The Wheel of Time, Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan, The Underground Railroad, Sound of Metal, Coming 2 America, The Tomorrow War, and Being the Ricardos. This September, Prime Video will release the highly anticipated The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power and become the exclusive home of Thursday Night Football as part of a historic 11-year agreement with the National Football League (NFL). Since 2018 in the U.S., availability of Free Same-Day Delivery has expanded from 48 metropolitan areas to more than 90, items available for Prime free shipping have increased over 50%, and members have saved billions of dollars shopping Prime Day. This is all on top of new program benefits like prescription savings and fast, free delivery from Amazon Pharmacy and the continually growing Amazon Music for Prime members, Prime Reading, and Prime Gaming. With the continued expansion of Prime member benefits as well as the rise in wages and transportation costs, Amazon will increase the price of a Prime membership in the U.S., with the monthly fee going from $12.99 to $14.99, and the annual membership from $119 to $139. This is the first time Amazon has raised the price of Prime since 2018.

Fourth-quarter sales grew six percent organically, leading to full-year organic sales growth of four percent, driven by robust growth in Aerospace aftermarket, UOP, Advanced Materials, and Intelligrated. We leveraged HOS Gold to drive outstanding growth and expand segment margins by 70 basis points for the year. Earnings per share3 were $1.85 in the fourth quarter and $7.11 for the full year, up 10 percent year over year, excluding the fourth-quarter charge related to U.S. tax reform and other items, as a result of our strong focus on growth and productivity. Our businesses achieved exceptional free cash flow, with 123 percent conversion in the fourth quarter and 90 percent conversion for the full year, exceeding the high end of our guidance for 2017. While delivering outstanding 2017 results, we also made significant investments in our future, including funding more than $350 million in restructuring projects. We generated significant value for our shareowners in 2017 through a 12 percent increase in our dividend; $2.9 billion in share repurchases, including $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter; and the closing of three acquisitions. Our financial performance and aggressive capital deployment led to a total shareowner return of 35 percent, well ahead of the S&P’s total shareowner return of 22 percent and the median return of our multi-industry peers of 24 percent. Honeywell’s transformation to a software-industrial leader is well underway, and in 2018, we expect to complete the spin-offs of our Homes and Global Distribution business, and our Transportation Systems business, which will position Honeywell for future growth and margin expansion. After the spins, these businesses will be better positioned to maximize shareowner value through focused strategic decision making and capital allocation tailored for their end markets. I am confident in Honeywell’s future, and our ability to continue to deliver for our shareowners and our employees.

Our long-cycle orders and backlog were up over 15 percent for the year, which positions us well for 2019 and beyond. Our focus on generating profitable growth combined with productivity rigor drove 80 basis points of segment margin expansion this quarter, and 60 basis points for the full year, exceeding the long-term targets we set forth in 2017.

New Pfizer will be a smaller, science-based company with a singular focus on innovation while also continuing to allocate significant capital directly to shareholders, primarily through dividends. I am pleased with our 2019 financial results, which met or exceeded all components of our financial guidance. Our Biopharma business generated 8% operational revenue growth, driven by strong growth from Ibrance, Eliquis, Xeljanz and Vyndaqel/Vyndamax. As expected, the Upjohn business declined 16% operationally, primarily reflecting the U.S. loss of exclusivity of Lyrica in July 2019. Excluding Lyrica in the U.S. and the impact of other recent product losses of exclusivity, Upjohn revenues declined 3% operationally in 2019. We also returned $16.9 billion directly to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, demonstrating our continued commitment to returning capital to our shareholders.",2.617410999999997,0.4750230000000002,1.1161400000000017,0.0,0.0,0.9884,0.019,0.808,0.174,0.16222943722943722,0.45167748917748923,1616.0,235.0,6.8474576271186445,42.0,6.0,85.0,12.499325080682343,79.0,34.0,27.0,12.0,9.0,"[('2019', 4), ('Upjohn', 4), ('Pfizer', 4), ('year', 3), ('financial', 3), ('capital', 3), ('expected', 3), ('growth', 3), ('shareholders', 3), ('Mylan', 2)]",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.30701503740293795

Our record-breaking success at developing a vaccine against COVID-19, along with our partner BioNTech, is just one example of what we believe this new Pfizer is capable of achieving.

These files contain two notebooks that scraped and processed CEO quotes from press releases from the website www.sec.gov.
The original datasets are combined with their relevant stock prices and can be found in the folder Datasets

The file 'Mini library for CEO quotes offers a python library that comes with 3 methods.
The first two methods offer a list and dictionary of words and their chance to occur in CEO quote that has a rising stock price after a year
The third method expects as input a string of words and returns as output a value that tells you the likelihood that the string belongs to a press release that will have a rising stock price after a year.
For example a return of 2 indicates that the string of words is twice as likely to belong to a company that will have an increasing stock price after a year.

The final result is the result dataset.csv
This dataset contains the following columns:


Company: The company to which the row belongs to
Date: The date on which the filing or press release was published
Adj Close: Adjusted Close indicates the stock closing price for that given day.
Volume: The number of stock shares that were traded on this day
Press release: The CEO quotes that were scraped for a given company and a given date
Price change 12mo: This column presents the adjusted close price change. For example if the stock price in the row is 100 and the price after 12 months is 150, then the 12 month price change for this row will be 50.
Price change 8mo: Simillary, this price change indicates the same but over a time span of 8 months instead of 12.
Price change 4mo: This price change indicates the change over a time span of 4 months.
Price change: This column informs about the price change with regards to the latest row that has textual input in the press release column. For example if the press release column has textual input then for the next 11 columns the price change has been calculated to facilitate the price change with regards to when the press release occurred.
Price change pct: This column is similar to the Price change column above but calculates the percentage price change.
Compound: The Compound score is a metric that calculates the sum of all the lexicon ratings which have been normalized between -1(most extreme negative) and +1 (most extreme positive). This score has been calculated with the vader sentiment analysis. Vader is an abbreviation for Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner. It is a lexicon and rule-based feeling analysis instrument. With a mix of highlighted tokens VADER marks a score to mark each token as either positive and negative with a score between -1 and 1. The next three columns are derived from this.
Negative: A negative score is a score that has a compound score lower than -0.05
Neutral: A neutral score is a score that has a compound score between -0.05 and 0.05
Positive: A positive score is a score that has a compound score high than 0.05
Polarity: The polarity score is a float between 1 and -1. This score indicates a negative sentiment for -1 and a positive sentiment for 1. The library textblob provides a simple API to conduct polarity and subjectivity scores. 
Subjectivity: The subjectivity score is also a float between -1 and 1. According to the textblob library it refers to the general emotion or opinion.
Text length: Text length indicates the length of the text that was scraped. 
Word count: The word count is the amount of words that occur for the given text. More specifically, it is the text length split on whitespace. 
Word density: The word density is a value that has been calculated by dividing the text length by the word count. 
Punctuation count: This column represents the amount of punctuation that occurs per given text in the press release column.   
Upper case count: The amount of upper cases that occur
Stopword count: The amount of stop words that occur. The stop words that were taken into account are the stop words that occur in the spaCy library as stopwords.
Readability: The readability score is calculated with the Dale Chall readability metric. This metric can be found in the readability library [26]. The Dale Chall score is derived from a formula that is based on the use of familiar words, rather than syllable or letter counts. It indicates how easy it is to read a certain text based upon the familiarity of the words that occur in said text
Noun count: The amount of nouns that occur in the relevant text. The library TextBlob was used to identify each Part of Speech. 
Verb count: The amount of verbs that occur in the relevant text.
Adj count: The amount of adjectives that occur in the relevant text.
Adv count: The amount of adverbs that occur in the relevant text.
Pron count: The amount of pronouns that occur in the relevant text.
Top words: Top words is a list of tuples. Each tuple consists of a word and the amount of occurrences for that word in the press release text.
Price change sign long: This column contains either a value of -1 for when the price change 12mo is negative or a 1 for when the price change 12mo is positive.
Price change sign mid: This column contains either a value of -1 for when the price change 8mo is negative or a 1 for when the price change 8mo is positive.
Price change sign short: This column contains either a value of -1 for when the price change 4mo is negative or a 1 for when the price change 4mo is positive.
Word calculation: The word calculation is calculated by calculating for each word how likely it is to appear in a text that belongs to a company that has a rising stock price after a year. Then this value per word is multiplied by each other.

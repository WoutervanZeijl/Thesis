We remained focused on operational excellence and made early investments in profitable growth initiatives as we began to implement our new strategy. We are in the early stages of implementing our strategy for profitable growth. In 2018, we expect to make additional investments in the expanded offerings and services important for Caterpillar’s long-term success. We will use our Operating & Execution Model to bias resources to areas that represent the greatest opportunity for return on our investments. Our focus on operational excellence will not waver as we work to develop a more competitive and flexible cost structure, including implementing lean manufacturing principles. We are positioned to capitalize on continued sales momentum or quickly adjust should conditions change.",-28.750952999999996,-19.00246399999999,-15.526557999999994

Our margin performance reflected our diligent focus on maintaining a flexible and competitive cost structure. While sales declined modestly in 2019, we delivered an operating margin and free cash flow consistent with our long-term targets and continued to invest in services and expanded offerings. The team’s focus on executing our strategy for profitable growth also allowed us to increase our dividend by 20% and return more than $6 billion in capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We expect continued global economic uncertainty to pressure sales to users in 2020 and cause dealers to further reduce inventories. We have improved our lead times and remain prepared to respond quickly to any positive or negative changes in customer demand. We will continue to invest in services and expanded offerings to advance our strategy for long term profitable growth, while achieving our Investor Day targets.",51.641457,13.203469000000013,-13.016441

The excellent performance of our flagship smoke-free product IQOS -- not only in Asia, but also in the vast majority of our launch geographies -- underscored its great promise and the commitment of our employees to lead the transformation of our industry towards a smoke-free future. Continued investment behind IQOS in 2018 is expected to further drive its positive momentum. For the first time since 2011, we have entered the year with annual guidance that reflects a positive currency impact. Our combustible product portfolio provides us with a strong foundation. The confirmed potential of our smoke-free alternatives reinforces our strong determination to deploy all necessary resources to accelerate their growth, which will drive our business success and ability to generously reward our shareholders over the long term.",-20.436280000000004,-19.117466000000007,-18.167092000000004

2019-01-01,60.433731,157116000,"We closed out a challenging year with a robust financial and strategic performance across the business. Excluding inventory movements largely associated with heated tobacco unit volume in Japan, our total volume variance was flat -- our best annual performance since 2012 -- underpinned by a near doubling of global in-market sales of heated tobacco units. We grew our international market share by 0.5 points to reach 28.4%, and maintained a stable share of the cigarette category, highlighting our ability to successfully manage our transition to reduced-risk products. Our total net revenues were driven by an exceptional cigarette pricing variance of 7.6% and a strong contribution of more than $4 billion from our smoke-free products, despite the impact of the inventory adjustments. Our operating income was essentially flat, excluding currency, primarily reflecting increased investment behind our reduced-risk product portfolio. Our robust, currency-neutral double-digit adjusted EPS performance was assisted by a lower effective tax rate and interest expense. Thanks to the tremendous efforts of our employees around the world, and significant investments in portfolio development and organizational capabilities, including a state-of-the-art digital infrastructure to fuel our expansion, we believe we have laid the foundation for an even better performance in 2019. The underlying strength of our combustible tobacco business remains intact and our reduced-risk products are the catalysts to accelerate our business growth and secure the long term future of our company and the sustainability of our earnings and dividend growth.",-2.059902000000001,2.2090609999999984,8.614539999999998

2020-01-01,69.010696,102807900,"2019 marked a year of strong underlying business performance for PMI, driven by broad-based growth for IQOS and solid pricing for our combustible tobacco portfolio, with like-for-like adjusted diluted EPS up by 9.9%, excluding currency. We continue to make significant progress in the transformation of our business, with smoke-free products now accounting for 8% of shipment volume and nearly one-fifth of net revenues, while further demonstrating our ability to maintain combustible tobacco leadership internationally, as evidenced by Marlboro’s full-year cigarette share of 10% -- an all-time high. Although we anticipate a few temporary headwinds, notably in Indonesia, we enter 2020 with favorable momentum, and expect to deliver like-for-like currency-neutral net revenue and adjusted diluted EPS growth this year consistent with our 2019 to 2021 compound annual growth targets of at least 5% and 8%, as well as further margin expansion.",-0.15467799999998988,-9.499568999999994,-5.643153999999996

We must first and foremost salute the enormous efforts of the entire PMI organization to keep our employees and their families safe, ensure business continuity, rapidly adapt our ways of working and help our local communities. IQOS continued to deliver impressive growth in 2020, driving significant increases in our total users, as well as both HTU shipment and in-market sales volumes. During the fourth quarter, we reported record HTU market shares in key IQOS geographies, and exited the year with double-digit national shares in ten markets. We enter 2021 with favorable momentum, although certain headwinds remain, notably related to Duty Free, Indonesia and the continued effects of the pandemic. For the full year, we are expecting a significant recovery, with mid-single-digit organic net revenue growth—driven by the growing contribution of IQOS—and further efforts on cost efficiencies driving an acceleration in forecasted adjusted diluted EPS growth to a range of 9% to 11% on the same basis.",23.122223000000005,18.489456000000004,14.785331999999997

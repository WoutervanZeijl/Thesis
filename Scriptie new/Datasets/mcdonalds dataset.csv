2018-01-01,150.376709,79270000,"2017 was a strong year for McDonald’s as customers responded to the many ways we are making their experience more convenient and enjoyable. We served more customers more often, achieved our best comparable sales performance in six years, gained share in markets around the world and made tremendous progress with growth platforms such as delivery, mobile order and pay and Experience of the Future. For 2018, we plan to invest about $2.4 billion of capital, the majority of which will be dedicated to reinvesting in our existing locations through accelerated deployment of Experience of the Future in the U.S. Our development plans also include the opening of about 1,000 new McDonald’s restaurants, 75% of which will be funded by our expanded network of developmental licensees and affiliates around the world. At the same time, we plan to continue making meaningful investments in technology to modernize the customer experience and redefine convenience. I’m confident that now is the opportune time to strategically invest in our business and our restaurants to drive profitable growth and become an even better McDonald’s. Our Velocity Growth Plan is working and we’re focused on aggressive execution in 2018 to achieve the even greater ambitions we have for our business and brand in the years ahead. With the commitment the McDonald’s system has to running great restaurants and maximizing our growth initiatives, we are confident that we will accelerate our momentum by capitalizing on our strong business model and distinct brand advantages in convenience, menu variety and value.",9.601257000000004,-0.5840910000000008,-8.890259000000015

Through the execution of our Velocity Growth Plan, we once again served more customers the food they crave, marking three consecutive years of global comparable guest count growth. In 2019, we completed our three-year cash return to shareholders target of $25 billion. This was a significant achievement given our substantial investments in Experience of the Future and technology. Our Velocity Growth Plan helped produce strong operating performance over the past several years, and our underlying financial strength continues to build long-term value for our shareholders. As we begin 2020, we remain committed to our capital allocation philosophy to reinvest in the business to drive profitable growth and return all free cash flow to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. The broad-based momentum around the world continues to demonstrate the strength of the Velocity Growth Plan and the dedication of millions of global crew members executing that plan in McDonald's restaurants each and every day.

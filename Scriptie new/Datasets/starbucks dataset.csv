As we enter fiscal 2019, we are executing against a clear growth agenda, with a focus on our long-term growth markets of the U.S. and China. We are also excited about the long-term growth potential of our new Global Coffee Alliance with Nestlé. I’m incredibly proud of our 350,000 Starbucks partners around the world and pleased with the continued progress in our growth agenda. In Q4, Starbucks delivered improved sequential results in both our Americas and China/Asia Pacific segments. We also further set the stage for increased benefits from our ongoing efforts to streamline the company. Each of these factors contributed to the record Q4 results we reported today and position us well for fiscal 2019 and beyond. As always, credit for Starbucks performance belongs to our store partners all around the world who proudly wear the green apron and deliver an elevated Starbucks Experience to our customers, every day.",16.925201,15.343222999999995,9.315449000000001

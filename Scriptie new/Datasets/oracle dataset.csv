Looking ahead to FY19, I expect revenue growth will enable us to deliver double-digit non-GAAP earnings per share growth once again. We had a great fourth quarter with total revenues more than $200 million above our constant currency forecast.

Our high-margin Fusion and NetSuite cloud applications businesses are growing rapidly, while we downsize our low-margin legacy hardware business. The net result of this shift away from commodity hardware to cloud applications was a Q4 non-GAAP operating margin of 47%, the highest we’ve seen in five years. Our Fusion ERP and HCM cloud applications suite revenues grew 32% in FY19. Our NetSuite ERP cloud applications revenues also grew 32% this year. These strong results extend Oracle’s already commanding lead in worldwide Cloud ERP. Our cloud applications businesses are growing faster than our competitors.

2020-06-01,52.64418,336706700,"In Q4, non-GAAP earnings per share grew 5% in constant currency driven by strong performances in both our cloud infrastructure and cloud applications businesses. Leading the way was our Fusion Cloud ERP Suite that grew 35% in constant currency, and our Fusion Cloud HCM Suite grew 29% in constant currency. Our overall business did remarkably well considering the pandemic, but our results would have been even better except for customers in the hardest-hit industries that we serve such as hospitality, retail, and transportation postponing some of their purchases. Still, for the third year in a row, we delivered double-digit constant currency earnings per share growth in FY20. In Q4, we launched a vastly improved version of our Exadata Cloud@Customer service. Exadata Cloud@Customer now enables our existing on-premise database customers to run the Oracle Autonomous Database in their own datacenter; previously, the Oracle Autonomous Database was only available in Oracle’s Gen2 Public Cloud.  Enabling all our on-premise database customers to upgrade and run Oracle’s latest and best database technology in their own data center should dramatically accelerate the rate of adoption of the Oracle Autonomous Database…especially by our largest customers including banks and governments that are not currently planning to move their largest and most critical systems to a public cloud.",23.594811,9.547711,1.0260280000000037

Our multi-billion dollar Fusion and NetSuite cloud applications businesses saw dramatic increases in their already rapid revenue growth rates: Fusion ERP was up 30% in Q3 and up 46% in Q4, Fusion HCM was up 23% in Q3 and up 35% in Q4, NetSuite was up 24% in Q3 and up 26% in Q4. Oracle Fusion is the world’s biggest cloud ERP business; Oracle NetSuite is the world’s second biggest cloud ERP business. Revenue from our Gen2 Cloud Infrastructure business including Autonomous Database grew over 100% in Q4. The accelerating growth rates of both our applications and infrastructure cloud businesses this year drove earnings per share growth up to 21% in FY21.  That is the fourth consecutive year of double-digit earnings per share growth at Oracle Corporation. The world’s two most popular databases are the Oracle Autonomous Database and Oracle MySQL. The Oracle Database once again delivered solid revenue growth in FY21.  And while our Oracle Database business as measured by revenue currently dwarfs our MySQL database business—that is about to change because the latest version of Oracle MySQL has been upgraded to include a revolutionary new ultra-high-performance parallel processing query engine called HeatWave. Independent analysts have tested and confirmed that Oracle MySQL with HeatWave runs 10 to 100 times faster than Amazon’s version of MySQL called Aurora. This technological breakthrough is causing several of Amazon’s customers to start moving their Aurora workloads to Oracle MySQL. And industry analysts are telling us they are seeing a 10x increase in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure customer inquiries. Both the Oracle Autonomous Database and Oracle MySQL with HeatWave technology have captured the technology high-ground in the cloud database business—and that bodes well for the future of the Oracle Cloud.",-4.6960380000000015,-1.0072249999999912,17.867744000000002

2022-06-01,68.657135,219800300,"We continued to improve our top line results again this quarter with total revenue growing 10% in constant currency. These consistent increases in our quarterly revenue growth rate typically have been driven by our market leading Fusion and NetSuite cloud applications. But this Q4, we also experienced a major increase in demand in our infrastructure cloud business—which grew 39% in constant currency. We believe that this revenue growth spike indicates that our infrastructure business has now entered a hyper-growth phase. Couple a high growth rate in our cloud infrastructure business with the newly acquired Cerner applications business—and Oracle finds itself in position to deliver stellar revenue growth over the next several quarters. Cerner and Oracle together have all the technologies required to provide healthcare professionals with better information—and better information will fundamentally transform healthcare. Better information will lead to better patient outcomes, better public health policy, lower overall healthcare costs, and a better quality of life—not just in rich countries—but throughout the world. During the pandemic, an award-winning Oracle cloud system called v-safeSM collected over 150 million patient records in the United States. An Oracle cloud system also managed vaccine programs in Ghana, Tasmania and dozens of other states and countries. We partnered with the University of Oxford to develop and deploy the Global Pathogen Analysis System (GPAS) that identified variants of the COVID-19 virus wherever and whenever they first appeared. A few weeks ago, we turned on a system to help researchers study a promising new HIV vaccine. There are so many opportunities to use information technology to improve healthcare and save lives. We made a good beginning during the pandemic—and we fully comprehend the importance of what remains to be done.",37.28286700000001,18.378394999999998,8.400749000000005

2018-01-01,136.889587,75463147,"Honeywell delivered a strong fourth quarter, capping an exceptional year for the company. Fourth-quarter sales grew six percent organically, leading to full-year organic sales growth of four percent, driven by robust growth in Aerospace aftermarket, UOP, Advanced Materials, and Intelligrated. We leveraged HOS Gold to drive outstanding growth and expand segment margins by 70 basis points for the year. Earnings per share3 were $1.85 in the fourth quarter and $7.11 for the full year, up 10 percent year over year, excluding the fourth-quarter charge related to U.S. tax reform and other items, as a result of our strong focus on growth and productivity. Our businesses achieved exceptional free cash flow, with 123 percent conversion in the fourth quarter and 90 percent conversion for the full year, exceeding the high end of our guidance for 2017. While delivering outstanding 2017 results, we also made significant investments in our future, including funding more than $350 million in restructuring projects. We generated significant value for our shareowners in 2017 through a 12 percent increase in our dividend; $2.9 billion in share repurchases, including $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter; and the closing of three acquisitions. Our financial performance and aggressive capital deployment led to a total shareowner return of 35 percent, well ahead of the S&P’s total shareowner return of 22 percent and the median return of our multi-industry peers of 24 percent. Honeywell’s transformation to a software-industrial leader is well underway, and in 2018, we expect to complete the spin-offs of our Homes and Global Distribution business, and our Transportation Systems business, which will position Honeywell for future growth and margin expansion. After the spins, these businesses will be better positioned to maximize shareowner value through focused strategic decision making and capital allocation tailored for their end markets. I am confident in Honeywell’s future, and our ability to continue to deliver for our shareowners and our employees. Our strong performance in 2017, together with the enactment of new U.S. tax legislation, has enabled us to increase our 401(k) match in the U.S. This is a sustained, annual benefit that will provide a more secure retirement for our employees. We believe that enhancing this benefit is extremely valuable and important to our employees over the long term.",-16.278221000000002,0.8351140000000044,-12.248565

2019-01-01,131.118774,60891600,"Honeywell delivered a strong fourth quarter to finish out what was an incredible year for our customers, our employees, and our shareowners. Organic sales were up 6 percent in the fourth quarter and full year, primarily driven by continued strength in our long-cycle businesses in commercial aerospace, U.S. defense, and warehouse automation. Our long-cycle orders and backlog were up over 15 percent for the year, which positions us well for 2019 and beyond. Our focus on generating profitable growth combined with productivity rigor drove 80 basis points of segment margin expansion this quarter, and 60 basis points for the full year, exceeding the long-term targets we set forth in 2017. This momentum resulted in adjusted earnings per share1 of $1.91, up 12 percent1 year-over-year, excluding the impact of the spin-offs completed in 2018. For the full year, we exceeded the high end of our original adjusted earnings per share and adjusted free cash flow guidance even after dilution from the spin-offs, while at the same time returning value to shareowners in the form of the spin dividends. We generated over $6 billion of cash for the year and reached 100 percent conversion2, a milestone for the company and proof that our initiatives are working. We expect to remain at similar levels for cash conversion in 2019, principally driven by continued working capital improvements. We have good momentum exiting 2018 after an exciting year. We continue to transform the portfolio, as we demonstrated with the successful spin-offs of our Homes and Transportation Systems businesses. We now have a simpler, more focused portfolio spread across six attractive end markets with approximately 60 percent of the portfolio growing sales at or above 5 percent organically for the full year. We effectively deployed capital to dividends, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and repurchases of Honeywell shares. Our dividend increase in September marked the ninth consecutive double-digit increase since 2010. We have an established software business and strategy in our connected enterprises which continues to grow at double-digit rates as our shift to a software-industrial company continues. We continue to make improvements in our supply chain and working capital to drive better sales, margin and free cash flow; and we have begun the digitization of Honeywell processes to improve organizational efficiency and enable enhanced analytics to drive better decision making. It’s an exciting time to be part of Honeywell, and we look forward to continuing our track record of matching our say with our do in 2019.",33.751114,20.698318999999998,28.232116999999988

2020-01-01,161.348877,54513600,"We finished 2019 with a strong fourth quarter. Organic sales were up 2% for the quarter and up 5% for the full year, driven by continued strength across Aerospace, growth in Process Solutions, and demand for commercial fire, security and building management products. We also had strong bookings in Intelligrated again, up over 100% in the fourth quarter. Our growth and productivity rigor, in addition to the impact of the 2018 spin-offs, drove 130 basis points of segment margin expansion in the quarter, and 150 basis points for the full year. This resulted in adjusted earnings per share of $2.06 for the quarter, up 11%1, and $8.16 for the year, up 10%4, excluding the impact of the spin-offs. We have continued to meet or exceed our guidance and the long-term targets we set forth in 2017, while further strengthening our balance sheet. We generated $6.3 billion of adjusted free cash flow for the year and achieved 105% conversion2. We continue to effectively deploy capital, and in 2019, we repurchased $4.4 billion of Honeywell shares, completed the acquisitions of TruTrak Flight Systems and Rebellion Photonics, made over 10 strategic investments within Honeywell Ventures, and announced our tenth consecutive double-digit dividend increase. 2019 was another exciting year for Honeywell, as we continued to build our Honeywell Connected Enterprise business, resulting in double-digit connected software growth, made significant progress within our Honeywell Digital and Integrated Supply Chain transformation initiatives, and launched a brand campaign that highlights some of Honeywell’s most exciting innovations. We delivered strong results, and entered 2020 with positive momentum, including a healthy long-cycle backlog that was up 10% year-over-year. I am confident that we will be able to continue to perform for our shareowners, our customers, and our employees in 2020.",41.39613300000002,-5.166595999999998,-28.458144999999973

2021-01-01,186.22612,58448400,"We finished a challenging 2020 with another quarter of sequential improvements in sales growth, margin expansion, and adjusted earnings per share. Our focus on delivering differentiated solutions drove double-digit organic sales growth in our defense and space, warehouse automation, personal protective equipment, and recurring connected software businesses for the second consecutive quarter. We continued to prudently reduce costs in the quarter, bringing our full-year total fixed cost savings to $1.5 billion. Our fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share was $2.07, flat year-over-year on an adjusted basis1 and above the high end of our guidance. We also continued our focus on generating cash and achieved 170% adjusted free cash flow conversion2 in the quarter. For the year, we generated $6.2 billion in operating cash flow with 130% conversion and $5.3 billion in free cash flow with 105% adjusted free cash flow conversion. Honeywell’s strong balance sheet put us in a good position to weather the challenges of 2020 while investing for future growth. We invested in high-return capital expenditures, repurchased $3.7 billion of Honeywell shares, completed three acquisitions, made six new investments within Honeywell Ventures, and announced our 11th consecutive dividend increase. Even with this level of cash deployment, we ended 2020 with $15.2 billion of cash and short-term investments on hand. I am very proud of the way Honeywell responded to the crisis in 2020. We quickly focused on liquidity, cost management, and execution, while rapidly innovating and ramping up production of a wide array of offerings to help the world recover, including critical personal protective equipment. We also remained focused on growth and investing in new markets and technologies. We entered 2021 with positive momentum following two quarters of sequential improvement.

We remained resilient, focusing on operational excellence to deliver the commitments we made to our shareowners. Our focus on differentiated solutions drove double-digit organic sales growth in 2021 in our warehouse and workflow solutions, productivity solutions and services, business and general aviation, advanced materials, and recurring connected software businesses. Our disciplined cost management, swift pricing actions to stay ahead of the inflation curve, and improved productivity resulted in 60 basis points of segment margin expansion for the year. As a result, our full-year adjusted earnings per share5 increased by 14% year over year. We also were strong cash generators in 2021, delivering $6.0 billion in operating cash flow with 109% conversion and $5.7 billion of free cash flow6 with 102% adjusted conversion and free cash flow margin of 17%. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we maintained our focus on executing our capital deployment strategy, including investing in high-return capital expenditures, repurchasing $3.4 billion of Honeywell shares, completing four acquisitions, and increasing the dividend for the 12th time in the past 11 years. We deployed capital in excess of our operating cash flow and will continue to follow this playbook in 2022. I am proud of the way Honeywell continues to respond to the challenging macroeconomic environment. We quickly took action to mitigate supply chain challenges and inflation by bringing on alternate suppliers, redesigning parts and implementing pricing actions. We also remained focused on growth, investing in new markets and technologies such as our environmental, social and governance (ESG) enablement solutions and the creation of Quantinuum, the world’s largest, most advanced integrated standalone quantum computing company.

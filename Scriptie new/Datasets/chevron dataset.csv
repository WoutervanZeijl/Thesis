We achieved our objective of being cash flow positive through deliberate actions to reduce capital expenditures, lower our cost structure, start and ramp-up projects, and conclude planned asset sales. Higher commodity prices helped as well. These improvements give us the confidence to increase the dividend by $0.04 per share, which puts us on track to make 2018 the 31st consecutive year with an increase in annual dividend payout. We replaced more than 150 percent of the reserves we produced, and reached several significant upstream project milestones in 2017",-9.746209000000007,0.32990200000000414,0.14769699999999375

During the second half of the year we repurchased $1.75 billion of the company’s stock, and earlier this week we announced a quarterly dividend increase of $0.07 per share. We reached significant milestones with upstream major capital projects in 2018, including the start-up of Wheatstone Train Two, our fifth operated LNG train in Australia. Our net oil-equivalent production grew more than 7 percent in 2018 to a record 2.93 million barrels per day. We expect that 2019 production will continue to grow by 4 to 7 percent, excluding the impact of asset sales.

Earlier this week, we announced a quarterly dividend increase of $0.10 per share, reinforcing our commitment to growing shareholder returns. In 2019, in addition to flaring and methane emission reduction targets, the company also established new performance goals to reduce net greenhouse gas emission intensity from upstream oil and natural gas production.

When market conditions deteriorated, we swiftly reduced capital spending by 35 percent from 2019 and also reduced operating costs, demonstrating our commitment to capital and cost discipline. Excluding severance expense, 2020 operating expenses were down $1.4 billion from the prior year. Chevron also completed an enterprise-wide transformation program and the integration of Noble Energy, positioning the company for the future.

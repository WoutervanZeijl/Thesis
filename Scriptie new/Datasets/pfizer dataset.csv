2018-01-01,28.719267,505479112,"Pfizer had a strong year in 2017, delivering solid financial results, advancing several significant pipeline programs and enhancing shareholder value with prudent capital allocation decisions. Regarding our revenue performance in 2017, Pfizer Innovative Health was driven by continued strength from several anchor brands, including Ibrance, Eliquis and Xeljanz -- all of which currently have market-leading positions with many years of patent protection remaining. Pfizer Essential Health generated strong operational revenue growth in emerging markets and in our Biosimilars portfolio but was negatively. impacted by the HIS divestiture, the expected impact of product losses of exclusivity and legacy Hospira product shortages in the U.S. In 2017, we received ten approvals from the FDA, significantly more than Pfizer has achieved in any year in the past decade. Building on these achievements, during 2018 we look forward to important regulatory decisions and clinical data readouts across our pipeline that will drive the next wave of innovation at Pfizer. I believe our capital allocation decisions in 2017 enhanced shareholder value. In addition to investing in our business, we also returned $12.7 billion directly to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases and we decided to explore potential strategic alternatives for our Consumer Healthcare business. We remain on track to make this decision, which could include everything from a full or partial separation to ultimately deciding to retain the business, during 2018. I believe our current management and business structure, the tireless dedication of our colleagues and the strong culture we have nurtured position Pfizer especially well for continued success. Overall, I am pleased with our 2017 financial performance. Despite absorbing a $2.1 billion impact from products that recently lost marketing exclusivity, we were still able to achieve 1% operational revenue growth in 2017 after excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures completed in 2016 and 2017. We also delivered Adjusted diluted EPS(2) growth of 11% in 2017, primarily reflecting a lower effective tax rate due to tax reform, strong performance of key products, continued success in managing our operating expenses and the net impact of our share repurchases.",6.334215000000004,6.400492000000003,-0.6025619999999989

2019-01-01,34.089809,631956054,"2018 was highlighted by solid financial performance, shareholder-friendly capital allocation, the strengthening of our pipeline and the formation of our new commercial structure designed to transition the company to a period post-2020 where we expect a higher and more sustained revenue growth profile. We enter 2019 with confidence in the competitive positioning of our businesses, the prospects for our recently launched products and product line extensions, as well as the strength and breadth of our research pipeline. Our focus remains on advancing science and innovation in areas that we believe will serve the unmet needs of patients and also create the most attractive opportunities for value creation. We see attractive opportunities globally to deliver value to patients, payors and other stakeholders through a combination of innovative biopharmaceutical medicines, vaccines, biosimilars, legacy brands and sterile injectable pharmaceutical products. I believe we have the business structure, leadership team and financial capability firmly in place to drive continued success. Overall, I was pleased with our 2018 financial performance. We were able to achieve 2% operational revenue growth for the year. We also delivered Adjusted diluted EPS(2) growth of 13% in 2018, primarily reflecting a lower effective tax rate on adjusted income(2) due to tax reform, higher adjusted other income(2), strong performance of certain key products and the net impact of our share repurchases. Regarding capital allocation decisions in 2018, we returned $20.2 billion directly to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends and also announced a new joint venture for Pfizer Consumer Healthcare with GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK)(3), delivering on our commitment to complete the strategic review for our Consumer Healthcare business in 2018.",-1.4577939999999998,-4.451076000000004,-0.4556350000000009

2020-01-01,31.016241,531835964,"2019 was a busy year, highlighted by solid financial performance, shareholder-friendly capital allocation, the strengthening of our pipeline as well as the formation of the Consumer Healthcare JV with GSK. We also announced a definitive agreement to combine Upjohn and Mylan to create a new global pharmaceutical company, Viatris, marking an important milestone in Pfizer’s evolution toward becoming a more focused, global leader in innovative medicines. 2020 is expected to be an exciting year for Pfizer with the close of the Upjohn-Mylan transaction anticipated by mid-year, leaving New Pfizer positioned to deliver revenue and Adjusted diluted EPS(3) growth that is expected to be among the industry leaders. New Pfizer will be a smaller, science-based company with a singular focus on innovation while also continuing to allocate significant capital directly to shareholders, primarily through dividends. I am pleased with our 2019 financial results, which met or exceeded all components of our financial guidance. Our Biopharma business generated 8% operational revenue growth, driven by strong growth from Ibrance, Eliquis, Xeljanz and Vyndaqel/Vyndamax. As expected, the Upjohn business declined 16% operationally, primarily reflecting the U.S. loss of exclusivity of Lyrica in July 2019. Excluding Lyrica in the U.S. and the impact of other recent product losses of exclusivity, Upjohn revenues declined 3% operationally in 2019. We also returned $16.9 billion directly to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, demonstrating our continued commitment to returning capital to our shareholders.",2.617410999999997,0.4750230000000002,1.1161400000000015

2021-01-01,32.802181,689094500,"2020 has been a transformational year, not only for Pfizer, but also in the life of every patient in every community that we serve. As a company, we saw the culmination of Pfizer’s decade-long conversion into a pure-play, science and innovation-focused company. Right away, our ability to move quickly and utilize cutting-edge science to help address the world’s most important medical challenges was put to the test by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our record-breaking success at developing a vaccine against COVID-19, along with our partner BioNTech, is just one example of what we believe this new Pfizer is capable of achieving. As the world looks forward to 2021 with renewed hope for better days ahead, we also look forward with renewed confidence and resolve in our ability to fulfill our purpose, to deliver breakthroughs that change patients’ lives. I am very pleased with how our company performed in 2020, and particularly in the fourth quarter, where we achieved double digit operational revenue growth driven by a wide range of products and geographies, including growth within all of our therapeutic areas. I was also pleased that Pfizer completed the transaction to combine Upjohn with Mylan to form Viatris in the fourth quarter, which I believe positions both Pfizer and Viatris for a bright future. I feel confident in our ability to continue to perform well and deliver on our commitments in 2021 and beyond, both to our patients and to our shareholders.",23.263458,7.678784,2.9707679999999996

We put billions of dollars of capital on the line in pursuit of those goals, not knowing whether those investments would ever pay off. Now, less than two years since we made that commitment, we are proud to say that we have delivered both the first FDA-authorized vaccine against COVID-19 (with our partner, BioNTech) and the first FDA-authorized oral treatment for COVID-19. These successes have not only made a positive difference in the world, but I believe they have fundamentally changed Pfizer and its culture forever. Everywhere I look in the company, I see colleagues who are inspired by what we have achieved to date and filled with determination to be part of the next breakthrough that could change the world for patients in need.

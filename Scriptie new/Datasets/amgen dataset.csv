2018-01-01,157.605637,66347900,"AMG generated excellent results for the fourth quarter and the full year 2017, including record Economic earnings per share of $4.68 for the quarter and $14.60 for the year. In addition to growth in our Economic earnings per share of 23% and 14% over the respective periods of 2016, our assets under management increased 21% year-over-year to a record $836 billion, driven by the long-term investment outperformance of our alpha-generating Affiliates and the strong execution of our growth strategy, including organic growth from net client cash flows and the ongoing success of our strategic initiatives to support and enhance our Affiliates’ new business momentum. Given the strength of our competitive position along with the increased scale and earnings power of our business, we have outstanding prospects for continued earnings growth going forward. We are pleased with the organic growth we generated in 2017, particularly given our substantial exposure to uncorrelated alternative strategies, which are optimally positioned for periods of market volatility. Across our diverse active equity and alternative product set, our Affiliates generated positive net client cash flows during both the quarter and the year, notwithstanding continued industry-wide net outflows in actively-managed product areas. Looking ahead, as one of the leading providers of alpha-generating strategies globally, AMG is well-positioned to meet increasing client demand for differentiated return streams. We are confident in our ability to continue to generate strong long-term earnings growth through accretive investments in outstanding new Affiliates, while also consistently returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Reflecting this confidence in our forward prospects, our Board of Directors approved a 50% increase in our dividend along with an additional stock repurchase authorization. Given our significant and growing scale, along with the ongoing organic growth of our business and our disciplined commitment to capital allocation, we are well-positioned to create long-term shareholder value.",12.147856999999988,14.25206,-8.683869000000016
